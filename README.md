# UNO-SENSE
## Overview of project
This project was part of a Summer internship opportunity at Delta Electronics from July 2020 - August 2020 where I spent my time writing an android application which could read air quality data from their UNO SENSE device and display it in real time. 

## Features of project
1. Connect to UNO Sense device
2. Display data from UNO Sense device
3. Update data from UNO Sense device in real time
4. Implement a widget so that information can be displayed in real time on the home screen

## Technologies used:
- Java

## Additional notes
It should be noted that this project was done long before learning good proper programming concepts such as organized file structure and useful commenting. This has since improved. The final product however is still worth publishing due to its core abilities.
